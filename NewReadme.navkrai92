#####Description of the tasks performed in Script
In this Test, the technique I preferred for exploiting the system is Network Service Scanning. With this technique adversary is able to obtain a list of servicers running on the system and is able to figure out services which can be exploited easily. In the network scanning before attacking the system I used a nmap scan on the remote system and find out the open ports and after that to be very sure again run the another tool which is also publically available and is a custom tool “Goldirony” for scanning the network.
After that adversary used the FIN6 which has inbuilt tools to map the network and gather information against Active Directory and other servers. To get the access of SAM file the tool used is “Mimikatz” and to extract or decrypt the hashes of SAM file APT3 is used. After that attack function is called to attack the system and T1122 is used to Hijack the system for a period of time and within that time it can steal the important data from the network. 
To mitigate these attacks Applocker on windows could be enabled which will restrict all the unintended services on a system.
The reason i prefer scanning the network is because it illustrates the information regarding the software version, operating system and Ports opened through the scanning process.
